# Dev Container PlantUML:

## Repo and Template Structure

This repository contains a _collection_ of two Templates - `hello` and `color`. These Templates serve as simple template implementations which helps containerize the project. Similar to the [`devcontainers/templates`](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates) repo, this repository has a `src` folder.  Each Template has its own sub-folder, containing at least a `devcontainer-template.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. 

```
├── src
│   ├── plantuml
│   │   ├── devcontainer-template.json
│   │   └──| .devcontainer
│   │      └── devcontainer.json
├── test
│   ├── plantuml
│   │   └── test.sh
│   └──test-utils
│      └── test-utils.sh
...
```

### Options

All available options for a Template should be declared in the `devcontainer-template.json`. The syntax for the `options` property can be found in the [devcontainer Template json properties reference](https://containers.dev/implementors/templates#devcontainer-templatejson-properties).

For example, the `color` Template provides three possible options (`red`, `gold`, `green`), where the default value is set to "red".

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "options": {
        "favorite": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Choose your favorite color."
            "proposals": [
                "red",
                "gold",
                "green"
            ],
            "default": "red"
        }
    }
}
```
### Marking Template Public

For your Template to be used, it currently needs to be available publicly. By default, OCI Artifacts in GHCR are marked as `private`. 

To make them public, navigate to the Template's "package settings" page in GHCR, and set the visibility to 'public`. 

```
https://github.com/users/<owner>/packages/container/<repo>%2F<templateName>/settings
```

### Adding Templates to the Index

Next you will need to add your Templates collection to our [public index](https://containers.dev/templates) so that other community members can find them. Just follow these steps once per collection you create:

* Go to [github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io](github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io)
     * This is the GitHub repo backing the [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/) spec site
* Open a PR to modify the [collection-index.yml](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io/blob/gh-pages/_data/collection-index.yml) file

This index is from where [supporting tools](https://containers.dev/supporting) like [VS Code Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/templates/codespaces) surface Templates for their Dev Container Creation Configuration UI.

### Testing Templates

This repo contains a GitHub Action [workflow](.github/workflows/test-pr.yaml) for testing the Templates. Similar to the [`devcontainers/templates`](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates) repo, this repository has a `test` folder.  Each Template has its own sub-folder, containing at least a `test.sh`.

For running the tests locally, you would need to execute the following commands -

```
    ./.github/actions/smoke-test/build.sh ${TEMPLATE-ID} 
    ./.github/actions/smoke-test/test.sh ${TEMPLATE-ID} 
```

### Updating Documentation

This repo contains a GitHub Action [workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml) that will automatically generate documentation (ie. `README.md`) for each Template. This file will be auto-generated from the `devcontainer-template.json` and `NOTES.md`.
